   <h1>style-check.rb</h1> 

    <p>The code described in this README parses
    latex-formatted text in search of forbidden phrases and
    prints error messages formatted as if from a compiler.

    <h1>Why does this code exist?</h1> 

    <p>This code is a weapon against collaborators who would
    dilute your writing with ambiguous or verbose prose.  It
    was designed to ensure that collaborative papers appear
    in a consistent style: mine.
      
    <p>I think of all activities as coding.  My
    presentations use python scripts, not powerpoint.  My
    writing and research posters use latex and emacs, not
    word or publisher.  When I write code, I try to be
    creative and sloppy, relying on tools to identify most
    of my mistakes.  (For example, gcc issues warnings,
    splint can verify some memory processes, and custom
    scripts can identify simple portability problems.)  When
    writing text, I had no such tools.

    <p>The style checker is one such tool.  When I notice a
    mistake that can be identified by a regular expression,
    I add a forbidden expression to the style checker's
    ruleset.  Then, when I build my latex-formatted paper, I
    run the style checker to seek out such phrases.

    <p>It has saved me from submitting gramatically-sloppy
    last-minute edits.

    <p>Like the warnings printed by a compiler, errors from
    the style checker should not be taken literally.  Use
    your own judgement to correct sentences: make them
    shorter, more specific, and more varied.  I cannot
    advise you to rely on this tool in the way I do; my
    approach to writing is not necessarily a good one for
    anyone.

    <h1>How does it work?</h1> The style checker is a ruby
    script that seeks out files in directories
    /etc/style-check.d or ~/.style-check.d, or files named
    ~/.style-censor or ./style-censor.  Each file is a list
    of expressions in one of four types, annotated with a
    justification.  See the existing files for examples.
    
    <h2>Type 1: Syntax</h2> Syntax expressions are matched
    exactly. They are case-sensitive.  Any regular
    expression will do.  As a hint, "\b" will match some
    non-word character, like a space or newline.
<pre class="example">
[ ],       <span class="examplecomment">% syntax whitespace before comma seems wrong.</span>
''[\.,]    <span class="examplecomment">% syntax end quotes go outside punctuation like . and , </span>
[ ]-[ ]    <span class="examplecomment">% syntax a hyphen surrounded by space should probably be an emdash '---'</span>
</pre>

    <h2>Type 2: Capitalize</h2> Capitalize expressions match
    whole words, and are case-sensitive.  Such expressions
    are designed to help maintain uniformity of
    capitalization of product and project names, like
    PlanetLab, Scriptroute, CoDeeN, iPod, etc.  They are
    transparently wrapped with "\b"s to ensure that only
    whole words are matched.

<pre class="example">
Planetlab   <span class="examplecomment">% capitalize PlanetLab</span>
planetlab   <span class="examplecomment">% capitalize PlanetLab</span>
ccdf        <span class="examplecomment">% capitalize</span>
cisco       <span class="examplecomment">% capitalize the company name</span>
internet    <span class="examplecomment">% capitalize unless talking about an internet other than the Internet</span>
ttl         <span class="examplecomment">% capitalize</span>
</pre>

    <h2>Type 3: Phrase</h2> Phrases match longer phrases
    such as "the foreseeable future" or <a
    href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/pressrelease.html">"at
    the end of the day"</a>. As with capitalize expressions,
    they are transparently wrapped with "\b"s, but are not
    case sensitive.  Some phrases that should be forbidden
    include double words.

<pre class="example">
[^r][^c][^h] impact           <span class="examplecomment">% phrase "effect", "result", though nsf likes "research impact"</span>
absolutely essential          <span class="examplecomment">% phrase essential</span>
few in number                 <span class="examplecomment">% phrase few</span>
the the                       <span class="examplecomment">% phrase apparent double word.</span>
(quite|more|very|most) unique <span class="examplecomment">% phrase unique is.</span>
a large number of             <span class="examplecomment">% phrase you mean "many"</span>
the way in which              <span class="examplecomment">% phrase should be "how" or "" </span>
live in a vacuum              <span class="examplecomment">% phrase a tired metaphor that makes me want to vomit.  </span>
</pre>

    <h2>Type 4: Spelling</h2> Spelling expressions are
    internally handled just like phrases.  These are useful
    for common misspellings or typo's.  Perhaps you habitually
    misspell lose as loose and would prefer to have a checker
    complain.  I habitually misspell measurment, secrurity,
    and experiements.

<pre class="example">
experiements <span class="examplecomment">% spelling</span>
measurment   <span class="examplecomment">% spelling</span>
secrurity    <span class="examplecomment">% spelling</span>
taht         <span class="examplecomment">% spelling</span>
teh          <span class="examplecomment">% spelling</span>
privledge    <span class="examplecomment">% spelling "privilege" I misspell it every way possible.</span>
privlege     <span class="examplecomment">% spelling "privilege" I misspell it every way possible.</span>
priviledge   <span class="examplecomment">% spelling "privilege" I misspell it every way possible.</span>
queueing     <span class="examplecomment">% spelling I'd love to spell it this way, but spellchecker whines.</span>
</pre>

    <h2>Type -1: Ignored Commands</h2> Ignore the parameter
    to this command.  If only spell checkers were this cool.
    The standard ignored commands are \begin, \end, \url,
    \cite, \ref, \label, and a few others.  You can extend
    this in ./censor-dict with a personal dictionary that
    might include, for example \todo or \hostname.  The
    internal implementation of ignored commands is to
    "replace" them with ~ (the non-breaking space character)
    before the rest of the rules are checked, so it is
    possible that other rules may need to take this into
    account.

<pre class="example">
todo      <span class="examplecomment">% ignoredcommand</span>
texttt    <span class="examplecomment">% ignoredcommand</span>
</pre>

    <h2>Built-in checking</h2>
    <p>In addition to configurable rules, the style checker
    also seeks out common errors within the LaTeX source
    itself: <ul>

      <li>an unescaped percent-sign directly following a
    number is frequently an error.</li>
      <li>a \cite{} tag should precede (not follow) a period.</li>
      <li>a \cite{} tag should not be used obviously as a noun in 
        the middle of a sentence.</li>
      <li>paragraphs should end with the end of a sentence.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Comments using \begin{comment} and \end{comment} from 
    comment.sty are skipped.

    <p>Math mode between unescaped $'s is skipped. 

    <p>For more detail, read the ruby code.  It's shorter
    than this file.

    <h1>How do I use it?</h1> 

    From the style-check-(version) directory, run <br>
    <tt>sudo make install</tt> <br>
    to install as the superuser.  As an alternative, <br>
    <tt>make user-install</tt><br>
     will put the
    ruleset in your home-directory, but putting the
    style-check.rb script in your path is up to you.
  
    If you are using Windows, you are suggested to install  <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> first (make sure you install "ruby" and "make" package during the installation of Cygwin.
   
    <p>To run the script,<br>
    <tt>style-check.rb *.tex</tt>

    <p>Or, if you'd like a little justification with your scolding, <br> 
    <tt>style-check.rb -v *.tex</tt>

    <h1>Limitations</h1> This is not a proof-reader, editor,
    spelling checker, or grammar checker.  It can catch only
    some simple, common, frustrating mistakes.  It is not a
    substitute for reading what I've listed below.  It is intended
    only for LaTeX files.

    <p>This code will not teach you to use "that" and
    "which" properly.  It will not teach you to hyphenate.
    It may be used for evil.  You may think my rules are
    stupid.

    <p>There are many bugs in the code; it is not guaranteed
    that the style checker will find all forbidden phrases. It 
      may become confused by nested environments.
     

    <h1>Attitude</h1>

    <p>Don't ask me to add a feature.  Send me a patch.

    <p>Don't complain that it's written in Ruby.  My
    language kicks your language's ass.

    <p>Don't complain about the ruleset.  Invent a mechanism
    to override ones you don't care for.

    <h1>Further Reading</h1> This section is split into two
    categories -- entertainment for reading that is light
    and fun and should help you think about writing better,
    and reference that may help answer harder questions.

    <p>Michael Haardt wrote GNU <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diction/diction.html">diction</a>,
    which is similar in that it finds and complains about
    bad phrases, but different in that it also notes
    questionable phrases (such as any use of "affect") and
    does not expect to check LaTeX source.  Style-check
    focuses on forbidden phrases and common typographic
    errors in LaTeX code.
